### Get Started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn run cannon-build` to locally build the `synthetix-periphery` cannon build. See `cannonfile.toml`.
3. Run `yarn run write-deployments` to generate the deployment JSON files for each supported network.
   --- _Note: If you changed the name of the build in `cannonfile.toml`, you will need to change the name parameter for the `write-deployments` script in `package.json`._
